# Gottack
Universal Adversarial Attacks on Graph
Neural Networks via Graph Orbits Learning

**Credits:**    
- The OrbitAttack is implemented with reference to ````Nettack````'s source code,
a method proposed in the paper: 'Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks for Graph Data'
by Daniel Zügner, Amir Akbarnejad and Stephan Günnemann
- Gottack is built on top of ````DeepRobust```` - A PyTorch Library for Adversarial
Attacks and Defenses developed by Yaxin Li, Wei Jin, Han Xu and Jiliang Tang

## Instruction

1. Set up virtual environment (conda should work as well).

```
python -m venv gottack/
source gottack/bin/activate
```

2. Upgrade pip (Optional)

```
install external packages
```

3. Install Gottack dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Results of Gottack can be re-produced by running ```main.py```. Please see ```main.py``` for
further instructions.
